# Architecture decision records

Here, you can find a list list of [ADRs](https://adr.github.io/) that we prepared for the CoreLibrary project. The list is non-exhaustive and resembles only some of our decisions, but serves the puprose of displaying how we approach creating ADRs.

1. [Value objects](./2021-02-04_value_object.md),
2. [Optimistic Concurrency](./2021-11-25_optimistic_concurrency.md).
