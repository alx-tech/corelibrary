# Domain

**Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** is an approach to software development that aims to align the development team's understanding of the problem domain with the actual domain as it exists in the real world. This library utilizes DDD to structure its codebase around the core concepts and relationships within the domain.

## Key concepts and principles of DDD

- **Ubiquitous Language:** DDD encourages the use of a shared, consistent language between developers and domain experts. This language should be used in communication, code, and documentation, ensuring that everyone has a common understanding of the concepts within the domain.
- **Bounded Contexts:** DDD recognizes that different parts of a system may have different models of the same concept. Bounded contexts define explicit boundaries within which a particular model is defined and applicable. This helps to avoid confusion and conflicts in the understanding of domain concepts.
- **Aggregates:** Aggregates are clusters of associated objects treated as a unit for data changes. They help in maintaining consistency within the domain by ensuring that changes to the objects within an aggregate are made in a consistent and atomic manner.
- **Entities and Value Objects:** DDD distinguishes between entities and value objects. Entities are objects with a distinct identity that runs through time and different states. Value objects, on the other hand, are objects without a distinct identity. Understanding these distinctions helps in designing more accurate and maintainable domain models.
- **Domain Events:** Domain events represent state changes within the domain. They are used to communicate changes and trigger actions in other parts of the system.

## Why DDD?

- **Better Communication:** DDD promotes a shared understanding of the problem domain, fostering better communication between developers and domain experts.
- **Maintainability:** By aligning the software design with the problem domain, code becomes more maintainable over time. Changes to the system are more likely to reflect real-world changes in the business.
- **Reduced Complexity:** DDD provides tools and patterns for managing complexity by breaking down the problem domain into more manageable components.
- **Agility:** DDD can contribute to increased agility by allowing developers to respond more effectively to changing business requirements.
- **Quality Software:** By focusing on the core domain and modeling it accurately, DDD helps in the development of high-quality software that closely matches the needs of the business.
