The LeanCode Core Library is a set of helper libraries developed at [our company](https://leancode.co/) that aids our day-to-day development. Not only does it serve as a facilitator in our day-to-day coding activities, but it also encapsulates comprehensive guidelines, gathers our collective knowledge on application architecture and development best practices.

Our primary objective is to provide a definitive and opinionated framework tailored for .NET Core application development. Within this framework, we've standardized various facets of application design and implementation:

* **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and CQRS-as-API:** Establishing conventions and practices for implementing CQRS patterns and their representation through APIs.

* **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Models:** Defining foundational DDD models and integrating them within the broader framework.

* **Integrations with External Services:** Pre-defined integrations and guidelines for interfacing with external services, ensuring consistency and reliability.

* **Additional Functionalities:** Including features such as handling audit logs, facilitating force updates, and localization.

* **Tests:** Helpers dedicated to aiding and improving the process of writing and executing tests.

While embodying the attributes of a framework, LeanCode Core Library aligns closely with the ASP.NET Core model, emphasizing modularity and minimal intrusion into the application codebase.
